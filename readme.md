Welcome to Te-Do, a simple to-do list app for iOS, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedo_Zibzibadze">Tedo Zibzibadze</a>, a Georgian rugby union player.

Once it is completed, the main features of it will be:

### FOSS:
All code of this project is hosted on GitHub. The app is completely free as in freedom, meaning there will not be any charges ever. This is as opposed to most popular to-do list apps, which are mostly subscription based.

### Lightweight: 
The app is made to be very simple, free from any 'bloat' (extra features that you won't ever use). There is no calender, groups, or any other features; if you want an all-in-one app, please leave and go spend your money on some electron app that runs slowly and charges you 10$ per month for writing words next to a checkbox. This is in line with the Unix philosphy: Apps should do one thing, and do it well.
However, if the app becomes widely used, 'plugins' might be implemented, so you can expand the app how you want. Until then, you can fork the code using Github. This is another perk of the app being foss. 

### Intuitive:
The app works how you want. And if it doesn't, you can spend a few minutes in the settings menu, where almost everything can be changed. By default, completed tasks are crossed out and moved to the bottom of the list, but can still be easily viewed. 

### Reminders:
The app features simple notification reminders for when your task is due. 

#### tbc:
There are some features which would be nice to add but would be hard to implement. These include:

*Sync:* An account system so you can access your notes from any device.
<br>
*Other Platforms:* A destop app, or maybe even a web app, to help you be organised whatever you are doing.
<br>
*Themeing:* The app will probably come with a light and dark theme. But it would be good to make the appearance fully customisable by the user, to enable community themes.
